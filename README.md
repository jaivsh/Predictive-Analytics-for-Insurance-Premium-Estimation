# Insurance Price Prediction System

The **Insurance Price Prediction System** is a machine learning-based web application designed to help users estimate insurance premiums based on their individual attributes and demographic information. With a focus on accuracy and ease of use, this project leverages advanced machine learning models to provide reliable cost estimations.

The application accepts user inputs such as age, BMI, gender, smoking habits, and region to predict the insurance premium with precision. The underlying models are trained using a robust dataset and optimized through various feature engineering and hyperparameter tuning techniques. The solution is deployed using Flask, providing a seamless interface for real-time predictions.

## Features
- **Accurate Premium Predictions**: Utilizes machine learning models like Gradient Boosting, Ridge, and Lasso for high-precision results.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Clean and intuitive UI design for easy navigation and interaction.
- **Real-Time Calculations**: Instantly provides insurance estimates based on user inputs.
- **Responsive Design**: Optimized for different screen sizes and devices.
- **Model Interpretability**: Understand how various features influence the insurance cost.

## Use Case
This project is ideal for demonstrating the potential of data science and machine learning in solving practical problems. It serves as a portfolio project to showcase your skills in data analysis, machine learning model development, and web application deployment.
